That's right, the website is now live and accessible online. 
I've been searching for quite a while for a free website 
hosting provider. I've tried WordPress but a free account 
got some limitations when editing the HTML and CSS files. I 
want total control over the looks of my site so WordPress 
weren't for me (for now at least).

I've even tried hosting with Google Drive by using the 
DriveToWeb service. It works but I hate how the URL 
generated was a bunch of gibberish string. I understand the 
intention but it bugged me.

Then, I found out about github pages. If you got a github 
account, you can host personal static website using a repo. 
This is just the thing I need. So, as everyone can see, this 
website won't ever be live, if not for github pages. Also, 
I'm striving to become a programmer anyway so why not setup 
a github account already?

Yeah. I might do something with my new website so check out 
every so often to see what's new.
