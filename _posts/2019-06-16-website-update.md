Happy Father's Day!

It's quite a while since my first post.
I finished college and have a lot of free
time on my hands. Figured I might as well
spend the time to create something.

For the past few months, I've spent some
time prototyping stuff in Javascript.
One of the first thing I've created is a
Pong game. Quite proud of it since it
look nice on most of the browser I've tested.
There's also a John Conway's Game of Life
program that I've created. It fills the
screen and scale each cells accordingly.

Oh, and I've created a Normal Distribution
Graph in Java that will automatically find
the probability of a certain Z-score on the
graph. This program is written for Kedah
Matriculation College's Mathematics Unit.

So, what next? I'm trying to learn Socket
Programming. I'm kinda interested in
making a simple multiplayer game. Probably
would start with making that Pong game
multiplayer.

Anyways, that's all for now! Have a good day
and Happy Father's Day for my beloved father.
