<p class="section-title">19 August 2019 - Return to Github Pages</p>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Another quick update. I'm going to use the Github Page to host my site again. Even though Firebase has more features, I'm afraid if I created something with it, I might exceed the free plan limitation and forced to pay. Even if there's still a way limit the usage, it will be a bad experience if there's occassional downtimes. So, I'm moving back to Github Pages.</p>
<p>However, I might come back to it in the future when I can afford their plans.</p>

<p class="section-title">18 August 2019 - New Game available (kinda)</p>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>A new game is now available! There'll be a new option on the navbar that will direct you to a page where you can play my version of Flappy Bird (so original)!<br/>
I tried to recreate the physics of the original game. So don't blame me if it's hard. üòú</p>

<p class="section-title">3 August 2019 - Surprise!</p>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>After around 3-4 months (I believe) graduating from college, I'm about to continue my studies in Information Technology (Hons) at Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM). Spent a few days prepping all the paperworks and documents. One of my friends in college was also accepted there albeit in a different course. It's also a short distance away from KMK so can't wait to see my friends that's still there.</p>
<p>Speaking of my friend still in KMK, I prepared a surprise for one of you <a href="birthday.html">here</a>. You know who it is for.<br/>P/S: Sorry if it's too late. It's a mess to do all this üòù</p>
<p>It's a fairly quick update for now.</p>

<p class="section-title">22 June 2019 - Website Migration</p>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>As you can see, the website have migrated to a brand new web host. The website no longer hosted by Github Pages, instead it's now hosted by Firebase Web Hosting. In addition to the host change, I even updated the site with a brand new look. It looks slicker and more professional than before.</p>
<p>There were two reason for this change. First of all, Firebase Web Hosting gave you two different URL for your site, which were <project-id>.firebaseapp.com and <project-id>.web.app. I'm hooked by the second URL, which is nice and simple. You don't have to type a long URL to access my site.</p>
<p>The final reason was the other features offered by Firebase itself. With features such as Firebase Cloud Functions, Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Cloud Storage, there's even more stuff possible. For example, I can start making multiplayer games using Realtime Database and integrate my programs with Firebase Authentication. Features like Leaderboards are even possible due to Firebase. You just have to wait for what's coming in the future.</p>
<p>That's all for this current update. I don't know what to do with the old site on Github Pages. It maybe will redirect to the new site. Anyway, stay tuned for any new updates.</p>
