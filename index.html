<p>My name is dfx and welcome to my site.</p>
<p>I'll be programming various games and 
softwares, some of which will have their 
own site setup. In this case, this site 
acts as a hub that link to each of those 
webpages. My blog will also acts as a dev 
diary. So I might write anything related to 
my latest projects there.</p>
<p>For most of my stuff, they'll be available 
on my github repository. But for anyone 
who aren't familiar on how github works, 
Google Drive links are also available.</p>
<p>As for Android apps, they'll be posted 
here until I get my developer license 
(which will be soon!).</p>
<p>For now, I added a link to an old-school
game of Pong that I programmed 
from scratch in Javascript. I might create 
a tutorial if there's any interest.<br/>
My version of Pong is simple and even works 
on a phone. Simply use the arrow keys on a 
keyboard to move the paddle or touch the 
screen to make the paddle move towards the 
touch point. The first player to reach 10 
points wins. Good luck!</p>
